## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Each lab may have its own setup requirements. However, the general recommended setup includes:

### üíª System Requirements

**Operating System:**
- Linux (Ubuntu preferred)
- Windows 10 (for PE analysis labs)
- Android Emulator or physical device (for rooting lab)

**Virtualization Tools:**

- **Static Analysis**: `Ghidra`, `strings`, `objdump`, `file`, `readelf`
- **Network Analysis**: `tcpdump`, `Wireshark`, `Snort`
- **Malware Sandboxing**: `Cuckoo Sandbox` (for isolated dynamic analysis)
- **Web Security**: `Burp Suite`, `Postman`, `Firefox` with security extensions
- **Mobile Security**: `Android SDK`, `adb`, custom ROMs (e.g., `LineageOS`)
- **Web Development**: `Node.js`, `Express`, `Flask`, `nginx`

### üß™ Programming Languages

- Python 3.x (primary scripting language)
